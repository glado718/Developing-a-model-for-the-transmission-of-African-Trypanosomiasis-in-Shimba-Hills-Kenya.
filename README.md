# Modeling-the-transmission-dynamics-of-Trypanosomiasis;A-case-study-of-Shimba-Hills-Kenya
A project for developing a model for the transmission of African Trypanosomiasis in Shimba Hills and estimating the basic reproduction number which will help document the special distribution of trypanosomiasis in Shimba Hills
## Objectives
1. To develop a SIR model that simulates the trypanosome-vector-host transmission in Shimba Hills, Kenya.
2. To estimate the basic reproduction number (Rh0) and document the distribution of trypanosomiasis in Shimba Hills and areas around Shimba Hills National Reserve (SHNR)

## Problem statement
High prevalence of AAT in SHNR, 54.6% of the total cattle sampled population tested positive for trypanosome parasites (Saini et al., 2017) 

High bovine trypanosomosis prevalence (33.9%) and morbidity rate (29.1%) in Shimba Hills (Mbahin et al., 2013)

Critical in understanding how efficiently a trypanosome can be transmitted in a certain population from one host to another 

No study has been done to show how efficiently a trypanosome can be transmitted in a certain population 

Farmers are totally dependent on trypanocides to control AAT subjecting livestock to trypanocide resistance


Mathematical models have been used to study the transmission dynamics and device effective management measures of AAT

Cattle population:

The susceptible cattle population decreases with time

More susceptible animals come into contact with the infectious tsetse fly population over time and then moved to the infectious compartment

The number of infected cattle increases with time 

More cattle get infected at the start of the model, as they progress, the infectious animals decrease because the cattle recover or die from nagana 

The removed/dead cattle population increases with time
Increases inversely to the susceptible cattle population as they are moved to the infected compartment 
Cattle die or recover from nagana

Tsetse fly population:

The tsetse fly susceptible population decreases  with time
With time, more susceptible flies come into contact with the infectious cattle population
Spraying with insecticides reduces vulnerable vector abundance 

Infected tsetse fly population increases with time
In case of an infection, the infected tsetse population is moved to the infectious compartment 
The infection rate is dependent on the tsetse fly biting rate on cattle

The estimated basic reproduction number for the study is: 
    R0 ‚âà (2.73) = ùëÖ0 > 1 

This indicates that the AAT disease persists in the study populations

Estimation from all five villages involved in the study (Kipambane, Msulwa A, Pengo, Mlafyeni, Msulwa A, and Shimba Hills)
 
The R0 value (ùëÖ" = 2.73) signifies that Nagana disease cannot be easily eliminated unless the right control measures are put in place 

The levels of Animal African trypanosomosis pose a challenge to implementation, control, and surveillance methods in areas surrounding the Shimba Hills National Reserve 


## Conclusions 
This project successfully developed a compartmental SIR model to simulate AAT transmission dynamics, estimated the basic reproduction number, and documented the distribution risk around SHNR

Areas near the park had high infection rates compared to those located away from the park

Despite the high tsetse abundance and biting rates around SHNR, infection rates on cattle are minimal

If targeted control measures are not implemented, AAT cannot be easily eliminated in areas around Shimba Hills National Reserve 

The results of this research will help in devising management strategies, guiding farmers on the transmission risks, and  to device public health policies

## Recommendations
The model developed in this study will further help mathematicians and epidemiologists develop more complex and suitable models to represent different AAT disease scenarios in Shimba Hills


A more complex model can be developed including more parameters, environmental factors, and management measures


Data collected over two or many years could be used for better model visualization


 Assessment can be done for a larger area, covering many villages, for better results
