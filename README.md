# Modeling-the-transmission-dynamics-of-Trypanosomiasis;A-case-study-of-Shimba-Hills-Kenya.
A project for developing a model for the transmission of African Trypanosomiasis in Shimba Hills and estimating the basic reproduction number which will help document the special distribution of trypanosomiasis in Shimba Hills
## Objectives
1. To develop a SIR model that simulates the trypanosome-vector-host transmission in Shimba Hills, Kenya.
2. To estimate the basic reproduction number (Rh0) and document the distribution of trypanosomiasis in Shimba Hills and areas around Shimba Hills National Reserve (SHNR).
