# Modeling-the-transmission-dynamics-of-Trypanosomiasis;A-case-study-of-Shimba-Hills-Kenya
A project for developing a model for the transmission of African Trypanosomiasis in Shimba Hills and estimating the basic reproduction number which will help document the special distribution of trypanosomiasis in Shimba Hills
## Objectives
1. To develop a SIR model that simulates the trypanosome-vector-host transmission in Shimba Hills, Kenya.
2. To estimate the basic reproduction number (Rh0) and document the distribution of trypanosomiasis in Shimba Hills and areas around Shimba Hills National Reserve (SHNR)

## Problem statement
High prevalence of AAT in SHNR, 54.6% of the total cattle sampled population tested positive for trypanosome parasites (Saini et al., 2017) 

High bovine trypanosomosis prevalence (33.9%) and morbidity rate (29.1%) in Shimba Hills (Mbahin et al., 2013)

Critical in understanding how efficiently a trypanosome can be transmitted in a certain population from one host to another 

No study has been done to show how efficiently a trypanosome can be transmitted in a certain population 

Farmers are totally dependent on trypanocides to control AAT subjecting livestock to trypanocide resistance


Mathematical models have been used to study the transmission dynamics and device effective management measures of AAT
